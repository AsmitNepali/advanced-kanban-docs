# Render Hooks

Advanced Kanban provides render hooks that allow you to add custom views before the search and at the board footer. Using these hooks, you can easily modify the appearance and behavior of your Kanban board.

## Available Hooks

Advanced Kanban provides two main render hooks:

- `KanbanRenderHook::KANBAN_SEARCH_BEFORE` - Add content before the search bar
- `KanbanRenderHook::KANBAN_PAGE_FOOTER` - Add content at the bottom of the page
